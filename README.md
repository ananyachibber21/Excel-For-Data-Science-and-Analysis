# Excel For Data Science and Analysis

In our day-to-day tasks, we use excel in performing almost all tasks whether it is collecting data, storing data, analysing data, or data cleaning. It is the primary knowledge that should be expected from a person expertizing in the field of Data Science. It is so simple to use and to store the results to provide a basic statistics of the given data.

## Power Queries

Power Query is a business intelligence tool available in Excel that allows you to import data from many different sources and then clean, transform and reshape your data as needed. It allows you to set up a query once and then reuse it with a simple refresh. It's also pretty powerful.

***Step 1-*** *Importing the files from the folder on your PC (files can be imported from Web or a Database as well).*

### Performing functions on an excel file is known as Data Cleaning.

***Step 5-*** *Performing operationas on the Data can be performed. To remove a column from the CSV file simply select the column from the header. Right click and and Remove.*
